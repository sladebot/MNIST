# MNIST Handwritten digit recogntion

## Dataset
We will be using the MNIST dataset. It contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits: 60,000 
for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are grayscale, 28x28 pixels, and centered to
reduce preprocessing and get started quicker.

##### hyperparameters
```
learning_rate = 0.01
momentum = 0.5
